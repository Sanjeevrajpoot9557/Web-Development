     <h2><center>About us</center></h2>

     <p>
     	It all started with seven people working in a 200-square-foot, windowless office. Founder John Gabbert was pursuing an idea his former employer nixed—a database that covered private equity.

        In 2009, we launched PitchBook Desktop. With each new dataset and feature, we‘ve expanded and improved. Now, PitchBook tracks every aspect of the public and private equity markets, including venture capital, private equity and M&A.

 
        Now part of Morningstar, we continue to give our clients the data and tools they need to be successful.
